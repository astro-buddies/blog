                <h3>Who is Fran?</h3>
                <p>Fran is the bestest friend in the whole world, and decided (still don't know why) to be 
                    my partner in crime in creating this blog. He's been passionate about astronomy for a few years now,
                    and with my (very slight) encouragement, he started competing in high school astronomy competitions with me.
                    He's such an overachiever, won <i>first place</i> (!!!), had a <i>killer research paper</i> (did some cool calculations of the temperatures
                    of stars), writes the best chord progressions, and loves writing.
                    </p>
                    <p>Always the funniest and brightest person in the room, really smart and really talented, he's the perfect person
                    to write with. Be ready for some <i>very</i> nerdy posts, with a lot of laughter and sarcasm on the side to make
                    learning ever so effortless.

                <h3>Who is Ema?</h3>
                <p>Watch out! Her bright smile might outshine the Sun and blind you!</p>
<p>Ema grew up with a dream to conquer the unknown, that is, our Cosmos. 
Competing in primary school and later in high school, she climbed up the ladder and reached the farthest secrets of the universe, even publishing a paper on the mystery of Blazhko stars! Later, she encouraged me to join her, and now it's us against the world. 
The kindest person I have ever met, she paints, she sings, never forgetting that art and science have a shared, 
special place in her heart. She is my fashion designer, professional stalker and certified bestie. 
</p>
<p>You will never see her without her coffee with sugar (or sugar with coffee in her case), 
so prepare to get the most wholesome hugs and cutest cheers from her!</p>
